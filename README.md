Hi there, 

I am the project manager : I need your help to build a new kind of modular tool

First, we will build a responsive one page web app with Javascript and ArangoDB 

We may not implement any library or framework except ArangoDB 3.x with Foxx, Bootstrap, or Vue.js 

The idea is to keep all code as clear and simple as possible

May you fork a smartphone app, make sure it is built as a module of the core web app


For now this is all we need :

- secure authentication for our online social network 

- all users registered in the Members collection in ArangoDB database DB001

- three roles for users : admin, helper, member 

- secure admin interface with messaging service to users

- a welcome page with direct link to EULA and registration filter from admin

- new welcome vue for registered members with real time and location at the top


We are the 9th of June 2017 : let's do this ! 

Var Pro001 = new App
