Hi there ! I am the project manager, with your help we are going to build a new kind of modular tool

First of all we will develop a responsive single page web app with Javascript and ArangoDB 

We may not implement any library or frameworks besides ArangoDB 3.x Foxx and Vue.js just now

The idea is to keep the code as clear and simple as possible from the outset

Would you fork a mobile app, please make sure it is built as a module from the main core app


So for the first stage this is all we need :

- secure authentication for our online social network 

- all users registered in the Members collection in ArangoDB database DB001

- three roles for users : admin, helper, member 

- secure admin interface with messaging service to users

- welcome page for visitors with direct link to EULA and registration filter from admin

- welcome view for registered members with local time and location displayed at the top


You may now join our coding team, let's do this !

Var Pro001 = new App
